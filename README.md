# ZB32

This repo is two things:
1. A useful(?) command-line utility for generating random strings from the Z-Base-32 alphabet
2. An exploration of what it's like to write such a utility in a variety of programming languages

For an explation of what Z-Base-32 **is** and why you might care, see the paper [human-oriented base-32 encoding](https://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt) by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn.
